## How to manually calculate cox hazard model survival probability without using survfit? 

Here is an example dataset `df`, 

 |      time| status|         x|
 |---------|--------|-------------|
| 2.2147182|  TRUE| 0.5345715 |
| 2.3603174 |  TRUE |0.2247599 |
| 0.3377275 |  TRUE |0.5525031 |
| 1.1139989 | FALSE | 1.1827877 |
| 0.7512806 |  TRUE | 0.6472115 |
| 3.7658282 |  TRUE | 0.1976087 |


Note that $S(t) = exp[-H(t)] = exp[-\int_{0}^{T}h(u) du]$, where $h(x) = h_0(t)exp(\beta \mathbf{X})$.

We fit the cox hazard model using 
```
cox_model <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ x, df)
```

Then the summary of fitted model using `summary(fit)` would be:
```
Call:
coxph(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ x, data = df)
  n= 100, number of events= 84 
    coef exp(coef) se(coef)     z Pr(>|z|)
x 0.2479    1.2813   0.1889 1.312    0.189
```
To find the survival probability first X covariate value, we can used `survfit`. 
```
summary(survfit(cox_model, newdata = data.frame(x = x[1])))
```
Then the result would be:
```

```
Let's say this is the **result 1** for the following section. 

We can also manually calculate it, using `basehaz`

Step.1 Find non-parametric estimate of the cumulative baseline hazard, $\widehat{H}_0(x)$, using `basehaz`
```
ind <- basehaz(cox_model, centered = FALSE)
```
Step.2 Find an estimate of the cumulative hazard for the first covariate $X$, $\widehat{H}(x)$, which can be obtained by 
```
H <- ind$hazard * exp(x[1] * cox_model$coefficients)
```
Note that it is equivalent to $\widehat{H}_0(x)exp(\beta X_1)$, where $\beta$ coefficient is 0.2479 and $X_1$ is 0.5345. 

Step.3 Find the $\widehat{S}(x) = exp(-\widehat{H}(x))$
```
S <- exp(-H)
```

## Subsequently, how to manually calculate cox hazard model survival probability at specific time point without using survfit? 

In the dataset, the first time point $t_1$ is 2.2147. By using the `survfit` function, we can easily determine the survival probability at $t_1$ with the following code:
```
summary(survfit(cox_model, newdata = data.frame(x = wj[1])), times = c(time[1]))
```
The result is 
```
 time n.risk n.event survival std.err lower 95% CI upper 95% CI
 2.21     36      58    0.436   0.058        0.336        0.566
```
It can be observed that the specific time point is obtained from **result 1** in line 8, which indicates the survival probability at time 2.21.

To manually obtain this information, we create a data frame using time points from the `basehaz` function and the survival rate $S$ derived in the previous section. Subsequently, we locate the index corresponding to the survival probability at time 2.21 and extract the survival probability at that specific time point.

```
df2 <- data.frame(time = ind$time, S)
index <- which(df2$time == time[1])
df2[,index]
```
The result would be:
```
       time         S
65 2.214718 0.4356264
```

## Find the survival probability at specific time point with different covariates using survfit
```
s.hat1 <- function(xj2, time2){
	s.fit <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ x, df)
	return(summary(survfit(s.fit,newdata=data.frame(x=xj2), type='kaplan-meier'),times=c(time2))$surv)
}
```

This function, named `s.hat`, is designed to calculate the survival probability at a specific time point (`time2`) for different covariate values (`xj2`) using the `survfit` function. It assumes a Cox Proportional-Hazards model (`coxph`) with survival times (`time`) and event indicators (`status`) as response variables and covariates (`x`) as predictors.

## Find the survival probability at specific time point with different covariates without using survfit
```
s.hat2 <- function(x, time){
  H <- ind$hazard * exp(x * cox_model$coefficients)
  S <- exp(-H)
  df2 <- data.frame(time = ind$time, S)
  idx <- which(df2$time == time)
  return(df2[idx,]$S)
}
```

The results obtained from `s.hat1` are 0.4324, 0.4031, 0.8733, 0.6549, 0.7384, 0.2722, 0.9071, 0.6169, 0.7412, 0.5238, and 0.6814. Similarly, the results from `s.hat2` are 0.4356, 0.4066, 0.8739, 0.6566, 0.7397, 0.2772, 0.9076, 0.6190, 0.7426, 0.5262, and 0.6830. While there are slight differences in the decimal points, it's evident that the results are comparable.
