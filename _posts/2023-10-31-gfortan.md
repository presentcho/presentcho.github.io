# Installing tar.gz Package on R with Apple M1 Chip

I'm currently using an Apple M1 chip iMac and faced challenges installing a tar.gz package on R. Typically, I would use the following command:

```
install.packages('packagename.tar.gz', repos = NULL, type = 'source')
```

However, I encountered the following error:
```
using C compiler: 'Apple clang version 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)'
sh: /opt/gfortran/bin/gfortran: No such file or directory
using SDK: ''
/opt/gfortran/bin/gfortran -arch arm64   -fPIC  -Wall -g -O2  -c  Adonnees.f90 -o Adonnees.o
make: /opt/gfortran/bin/gfortran: No such file or directory
```

To troubleshoot, I attempted the following methods:

## Method 1: Install GCC using Homebrew
Open your terminal and install GCC:
```
# if you don't have brew 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# then install gcc
brew install gcc
```
Verify if gfortran is updated:
```
gfortan --version
```
or you can check where it saved
```
which gfortan
```

If it is successfully installed, you will see a message:
```
GNU Fortran (Homebrew GCC 13.2.0) 13.2.0
Copyright (C) 2023 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
```

While Method 1 generally works, it didn't in my case. So, I proceeded to the next steps.

## Method 2: Download gfortran Bundle
```
curl -O https://mac.r-project.org/libs-arm64/gfortran-f51f1da0-darwin20.0-arm64.tar.gz
sudo tar fvxz gfortran-f51f1da0-darwin20.0-arm64.tar.gz -C /
```

Create a folder using '~/.R/Makevars' and add the following:
```
nano ~/.R/Makevars
# homebrew
FLIBS   =-L/opt/homebrew/opt/gfortran/lib
F77     = /opt/homebrew/bin/gfortran
FC      = /opt/homebrew/bin/gfortran

CFLAGS   = -I/opt/homebrew/include
CPPFLAGS = -I/opt/homebrew/include
CXXFLAGS = -I/opt/homebrew/include
```
Close with control^X and save.

Restart R Studio and run the code again in your R console:

```
install.packages('packagename.tar.gz', repos= NULL, type = 'source'
```
This should successfully download the R package.
